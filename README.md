kjournal closes the gap between long-term log storage and your client. kjournal is a simple and lightweight kubernetes api server 
which makes your longterm log storage available as consumable readonly kubernetes api.
With kjournal you can easily access container logs from old (and current pods) as well as other long-term logs including out of the box 
support for kubernetes audit logs and events.
